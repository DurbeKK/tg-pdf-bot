Basically all the files are managed like this:

- The files are separated into two: input files and output files.
- Input files are all the files sent by the user to the bot, that are temporarily 
  stored until a certain operation is complete.
- Output files are all the files temporarily stored until the bot sends the
  files to the user.
- Each user has his/her own directory in the user_files/input and
  user_files/output directory.

This is probably a very dumb way of doing it, when I figure out how to deal
with this better, I'll change this around.
